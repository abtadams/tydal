## Below are the use cases we anticipate for our 

### Use Case 0: Data Preparation
* Data Preparation
* Download Data for NOAA tidal stations and ADCP data
* Quality control the data
* Identify what tidal and current data

### Use Case 1/Module 1: Background about Tides
* Mostly background and intro to where tides come from
* Interactive plot showing tidal buldge and the Earth moving underneath the moon. 


### Use Case 2/Moduel 2: Tides and Elevation in the Straight of Juan de Fuca
* Show tidal elevations from several 
* Map of station locations: Neah Bay, Port Angeles, Port Townsend
* Generate surface tilt plot of the tide cycle/elevation at each of the stations
* User-slider in time to show how the tidal cycle at each changes changes the elevation between stations
* Ask user to think about what the tilt means and how water is going to flow

### Use Case 3/Module 3: Current Connection to Tides
* Introduce currents + tides with a figure/illustration
* Zero in on Port Townsend with the tidal elevations
* Show ferry-measured currents
* Allow the user to move through time to see the evolution of the currents with the tidal elevation
