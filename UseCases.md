We are developing CurrentsDiscovery as an interactive tool to use scientific measurements from the Strait of Juan de Fuca and Puget Sound to teach students about the basics of tides. The main questions we hope to address are:

* What causes tides?
* How does that manifest into water level in the Strait, and Puget Sound?
* What happens underneath the surface (i.e., how are tidal elevations and currents related)?
